        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hi, I'm Avery. I was born and raised outside of Atlanta, and 
            I'm a rising senior at Duke University.
            <br>
            <br>
            I plan to combine my interests in business and technology to bring meaningful change to
            our world.
        </p>
